# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
My hope is to help others in the future if they decide to review this and maybe even just a few notes would be key take-aways.
It will assist in recapturing and holding onto what was learned during the Prework process.
It can also help others who are new to coding.
I have learned about loops, functions, various terminology and how to structure & style a webpage.

## Installation

There is no necessary installation required to use this study-guide.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
