      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>While HTML strictly handles the structure and content of a page, CSS defines colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization.</li>
        <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS style sheets.</li>
        <li>Inline CSS is used to style a element directly within the HTML file, and will apply directly to a specific HTML tag.</li>
        <li>Inline CSS styles are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
        <li>An example of Inline CSS would be "h3 style="color: red;">Prework Study Guide /h3"</li>
        <li>It is possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a "style" element in the "head" element.</li>
        <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules will only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS </br>
          classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple leements in the page code.</li>
        <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using External CSS style sheets, because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file.</li>
        <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a "link" element place in the HTML's  "head" element.</li>
        <li>A link element will create the the connection to external files.</li>
        <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document relationship.</li>
        <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource. It can also use a relative path. This means the location is derived from the current location, in this case, index.html.</li>
        <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
        <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        <li>A class is defined using "class=xyz" and then recalled in CSS using the ."class name" to apply the properties to the element wearing the class. The I.D. for class will<br/>
          will identify where the class is being used. I.e. class="name" id="place to be used" and wrapped in your tag.</li>
        <li>The border property will add a border to the element applied to and is sized using px and then a color defined.</li>
        <li>The box-shadow property will add an outside shadow border to the border or element it is applied to. It is described by an x and y offset relative to the element applied to. <br/>
          These offsets are set in px and then a color defined.</li>
      </ul>
